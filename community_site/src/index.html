                "Community is an American comedy television series created by Dan Harmon that aired on NBC and Yahoo! Screen from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an ensemble cast of characters played by Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Yvette Nicole Brown, Alison Brie, Donald Glover, Ken Jeong, Chevy Chase, and Jim Rash at a community college in the fictional town of Greendale, Colorado. It makes heavy use of meta-humor and pop culture references, often parodying film and television clichés and tropes.<br>
                Harmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's "story circle" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' showrunner for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.<br>
                Community received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end "best-of" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a cult following. The show entered broadcast syndication in 2013, was released on DVD, and has been available to stream through Hulu in the U.S., Amazon Prime Video in Canada, Stan & Amazon Prime Video in Australia, Netflix in Ireland and Latin America and All 4 in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
                Jeff Winger is disbarred and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a bachelor's degree from Columbia University. This leaves him with no choice but to enroll at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his activist classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a study group in order to spend time with her.<br>
                However, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a pop culture-loving nerd, who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious single mother, naïve over-achiever Annie Edison, former high school football star Troy Barnes, and cynical elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.<br>
                While taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their unstable teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.<br>
                Season one follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season two continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Craig Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season three, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School." -Fandom
